Redi School - Java Intermediate - OOP Class & Objects - Creating a Car class and using it in different ways.

### Exercise (easy)

Create a Java class for the real-life object “**Car**”:
* Name your class file “**Car**”.
* You want to store the `name` of the car (a **String**).
* You want to store the `fuelLevel` of the car (a **number** between 0 and 100).
* You also want to store the `maxSpeed` of the car (a **number**).
* You also want to know if the car is `broken` (a **boolean**).
* You want the car to be able to `drive()` and to `refuel()`.

And then use the class “**Car**” by creating a new car object called “Mini”.
